**Branch**:
frontend_dev_deploy



**Progress**:

Just started to design testing cases and re-construct the logic of CLI menu, have come up with the sketch of the test cases followed the same template as sprint 4, .in file has been constructed for tests later, however, not yet finished the .out file as it requires the implmentation of frontend CLI menu.



**Difficulties**:
It reuires much additonal work to fit the CLI menu to the new functionalities, as well as the connectin bewtween it and backend models. 



**Plan**:
Need to finish frontend logic as soon as possible so that the testing cases could be finised based on that. Deployment through docker also requires the implementation of the whole system, including all the tests.
