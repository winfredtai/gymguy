# ðŸ”¥ Scrum Board Sprint 5 ðŸ”¥
meeting time: 2021.11.17

Daily standup meeting, report of progress and difficulties




### Team Member #1:

**Name**:

Jordan Belinsky
18JMB16
20164936



**Branch**:

security_test_register

**Progress**:

I have currently began mapping out the general structure for my security testing test cases, documenting and designing each case and planning how each will be implemented from a rough standpoint for the register functionality to be tested and confirmed working correctly.


**Difficulties**:


Despite overcoming this difficulty last time, I once again had difficulties in grasping the overall format for the CLI testing in order to comply with the exemplar repository that was given in the assignment instruction repository, specifically in regards to adapting to the new fuzzy testing format. As well, I had some difficulty understanding the proper docker implementation, but upon re reading through the exemplar I am getting more of a grasp.

**Plan**:

My plan for the rest of the sprint involves finalizing the design for my branch of security testing, at which point I will have a structure for each individual functionality test case. From that point it will be simpler to implement each test case, and thus that is my plan going forward!






### Team Member #2:

**Name**:

Winfred Tai

**Branch**:

docker_deploy


**Progress**:

Registered the first public dockerhub repository and built the image of Git repo.
Finished the deployment of version 1.0.0 container and pushed to the dockerhub public repository, the web application seemed to work properly as expected.


**Difficulties**:

Still unable to comprehensive the additonal files such as Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, wait-for-it.sh, as well as the modification to the qbay module init.py file,
looks like the sql name is changed. What I did was simply follow the "file_changed" of the branch cli_deploy and did the modification as the provided files.


**Plan**:

In the future I would like to search for online tutorial as what I've done before for git, trying to learn the basic concepts of a docker container, and try to configure the docker file on my own for better adaption to our application deployment.



### Team Member #3:

**Name**:

Sizhe Guan

**Branch**:

security_test_product


**Progress**:

I have currently added few test cases for the attributes in register function.


**Difficulties**:

I had difficulties in understanding the SQL injection testing and how to add the rest of test cases for attributes in create product function.


**Plan**:

I am going to understand the SQL injection testing and will add test cases to the create product function attributes. Lastly, check if there is any exceptions.


### Team Member #4:

**Name**:

Ziyuan Yu

**Branch**:

docker_interface


**Progress**:

I have currently began designing the general structure for web interface docker for user friendly and matching test cases of this project.


**Difficulties**:

Integrating all structures in the same docker is the difficulty I currently face because there are so many different situations that need to be considered, and some parts oof code designed by other teamates I need to understand.


**Plan**:

I am going to try to modify and optimize a part of the previous design to match all the situtations I can think of.
