Daily standup meeting, report of progress and difficulties




### Team Member #1:

**Name**:

Jordan Belinsky

**Branch**:

security_test_register

**Progress**:

I have currently began mapping out the general structure for my security testing test cases, documenting and designing each case and planning how each will be implemented from a rough standpoint for the register functionality to be tested and confirmed working correctly.


**Difficulties**:


Despite overcoming this difficulty last time, I once again had difficulties in grasping the overall format for the CLI testing in order to comply with the exemplar repository that was given in the assignment instruction repository, specifically in regards to adapting to the new fuzzy testing format. As well, I had some difficulty understanding the proper docker implementation, but upon re reading through the exemplar I am getting more of a grasp.

**Plan**:

My plan for the rest of the sprint involves finalizing the design for my branch of security testing, at which point I will have a structure for each individual functionality test case. From that point it will be simpler to implement each test case, and thus that is my plan going forward!

**Branch**:

security_test_product


**Progress**:

I have currently added few test cases for the attributes in register function.


**Difficulties**:

I had difficulties in understanding the SQL injection testing and how to add the rest of test cases for attributes in create product function.


**Plan**:

I am going to understand the SQL injection testing and will add test cases to the create product function attributes. Lastly, check if there is any exceptions.
