# In the test cases for 8 requirements , I used the blackbox testing
# and its three techniques. For the requirements of title, I apply the
# input partitioning method which test the cases of pure letters, pure
# numbers, combination of letters and numbers and so on. In the cases for
# price test, I apply the boundary testing to check if the limit of 10-10000
# actually restricts the price of product. Last but not least, I apply
# the functionality testing to the requirements of data time.
