Daily standup meeting, report of progress and difficulties


### Team Member #1:

**Name**:
Jordan Belinsky, 18JMB16, 20164936

**Branch**:
backend_purchase

**Progress**:
Completed implementation of the purchase functionality, and ensured that it is compatible with the rest of the tests and models predefined.

**Difficulties**:
As mentioned in the previous meeting, the product model we had already created was not setup properly to support the purchase functionality. So a difficulty was determining how to properly modify the product model (which ended up with adding a boolean isSold and a user email input) to fix this contingency issue.

**Plan**:
No direct plan is applicable at this point, aside from being available for questions from other group members, ready for PR reviews, and approvals.
