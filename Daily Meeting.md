Daily standup meeting, report of progress and difficulties




### Team Member #1:

**Name**:

Jordan Belinsky
18JMB16
20164936



**Branch**:

test_login_update

**Progress**:

I have currently completed the two base cases for the login page requirements (R2-1 and R2-2). I am applying black box testing methods into these completed tests currently, and annotation of the testing type is being added.


**Difficulties**:


I had difficulties in grasping the overall format for the CLI testing in order to comply with the exemplar repository that was given in the assignment instruction repository. As well, I had some difficulty determining how to best incorporate black box testing into the test cases, from a programmatic perspective rather than conceptual.

**Plan**:

My plan for the rest of the sprint involves extrapolating the work I have currently done onto the update user profile requirements, as written in assignment 2 entities instructions. Thus R3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4 will be added with separate functions. I also aim to add more input and output expected files for every test case, including those which have already been established, in order to further test black box methods.






### Team Member #2:

**Name**:

Winfred Tai 17zt12 20103850


**Branch**:

test_register


**Progress**:

R1-1 and R1-3-5 has been tested locally with one group of .in and .out file, not yet sufficient to apply the method of partitioning.


**Difficulties**:

The difficulty derives from the arrangement of multiple .in and .out files required to follow the Black Box testing methods, such as partitioning and exhaustive testing, this would result a complicated folder structure and test designs so that we could make sure (almost) all cases have been tested.


**Plan**:

My plan would be to incorporate the current progress to the black box testing methods by adding more test files, as well as arranging folders to the appropriate structure, each folder refers to one requirement with sub-folders contains more sub-folders of partitioning files, I also plan to adjust the prompt message when user does not follow the input requirement, for a more user-friendly interface.




### Team Member #3:

**Name**:

Sizhe Guan, 17sg46,20090459


**Branch**:

test_createproduct


**Progress**:

I have currently completed the two base cases for the login page requirements (R4-1 and R4-2). I am applying black box testing methods into these completed tests currently with input and output coverage testing.


**Difficulties**:

I had difficulties in designing the overall format for the CLI testing to make the in/out file been successfully runed in test_createproduct.py file. Also, For the three methods of black box testing, I only know how to do boundary testing for numeric attribute and the input output coverage testing is hard to implement since the attributes of a product are complicated. 


**Plan**:

There are 6 more attributes need to be tested and each of them have different boundaries so I am going to design the test case for the rest of requirements and try to combine some of them if their requirements are similar and can be tested together.


### Team Member #4:

**Name**:

Ziyuan Yu, 16zy18,20032445


**Branch**:

test_updateproduct


**Progress**:

I have already tested R5-1-2 locally of update product page. I am applying black box testing methods into these completed tests currently with input and output coverage testing.


**Difficulties**:

I had difficulties in designing the overall format for the CLI testing to make sure all cases can be tested from complex file structure formed by a large number of test files.


**Plan**:

My plan is to merge the current progress into the black box testing method by looking for the common parts of the test files, then deleting some of the test files, and arranging the folders in an appropriate structure, and incorporating the current progress into the black box testing method, each folder refers to a requirement. I also plan to adjust the prompt message when the user does not follow the input requirements and re-enter it to ensure that the current progress will not be lost due to input failure.
