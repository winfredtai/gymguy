**Branch**:

test_login_update

**Progress**:

I have currently completed the two base cases for the login page requirements (R2-1 and R2-2). I am applying black box testing methods into these completed tests currently, and annotation of the testing type is being added.


**Difficulties**:


I had difficulties in grasping the overall format for the CLI testing in order to comply with the exemplar repository that was given in the assignment instruction repository. As well, I had some difficulty determining how to best incorporate black box testing into the test cases, from a programmatic perspective rather than conceptual.

**Plan**:

My plan for the rest of the sprint involves extrapolating the work I have currently done onto the update user profile requirements, as written in assignment 2 entities instructions. Thus R3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4 will be added with separate functions. I also aim to add more input and output expected files for every test case, including those which have already been established, in order to further test black box methods.
