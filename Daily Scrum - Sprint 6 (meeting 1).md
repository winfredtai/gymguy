### Team Member #2:

**Name**:

Winfred Tai, 17zt12, 20103850


**Branch**:
frontend_dev_deploy



**Progress**:

Just started to design testing cases and re-construct the logic of CLI menu, have come up with the sketch of the test cases followed the same template as sprint 4, .in file has been constructed for tests later, however, not yet finished the .out file as it requires the implmentation of frontend CLI menu.



**Difficulties**:
It reuires much additonal work to fit the CLI menu to the new functionalities, as well as the connectin bewtween it and backend models. 



**Plan**:
Need to finish frontend logic as soon as possible so that the testing cases could be finised based on that. Deployment through docker also requires the implementation of the whole system, including all the tests.





### Team Member #3:

**Branch**:

backend_security_test


**Progress**:

 I am just having ideas about how to test the newly added features. The job of testing is built on the foundation of backend feature deployment and our backend developer has just finished the function design. 

**Difficulties**:

The placing order functionality is associated with both user and product database. The testing samples should follow the construction restrictions of two object models. Also there are many attributes related, I need to create lots of test cases to run through all possibilities.




**Plan**:

Planning to add true and false sample cases for each attribute of placing orders feature. The security testing is similar as the one we did before. It should pass since our implementation doesnâ€™t conclude and SQL code part.
